\section*{Interests and Objectives}

My main interest is \emph{High Performance Computing}. I am currently active in areas like \emph{Parallel Computing} and \emph{General-Purpose Computation on Graphics Processing Units (GPGPU)}. My motivation lies on applying all that computing knowledge to solve cross-disciplinary problems. In fact, my current projects involve parallel computing and 3D computer vision problems. My other related passions are physics, scientific simulations, 3D computer graphics, robotics and AI.

Being conscious of my limited knowledge in all those fields, I strive for seizing all the opportunities to learn and improve my skills in those fields and also discover current and future challenges to find my true passion and contribute where I can.
